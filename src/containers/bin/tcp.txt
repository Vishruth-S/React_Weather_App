Server Algorithm:-
1. Create a socket with type as SOCK_STREAM to create a tcp socket using socket()
system call.
2. Bind the socket to a specific port using bind() system call.
3. Listen for new connections using the listen() system call.
4. Accept connection from client process into a temporary socket.
5. Read the message from the client using the recv() system call into a buffer.
6. Display the message and close the socket.

Client Algorithm:-
1. Create a socket with type as SOCK_STREAM to create a tcp socket using socket()
system call.
2. Connect to the server using connect() system call.
3. Read the message to be sent from the user.
4. Send the message to the server using send() system call.
5. Close the socket
