for all destinations y in N:
Dx(y) = c(x,y) // If y is not a neighbour then c(x,y) = âˆž
for each neighbour w
Dw(y) = ? for all destination y in N.
for each neighbour w
send distance vector Dx = [ Dx(y) : y in N ] to w
loop
wait (until I receive any distance vector from some neighbour w)
for each y in N:
Dx(y) = minv{c(x,v)+Dv(y)}
If Dx(y) is changed for any destination y
Send distance vector Dx = [ Dx(y) : y in N ] to all neighbours
forever
